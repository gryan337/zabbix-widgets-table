## 🎯 Purpose

Zabbix is an incredibly powerful monitoring and observability platform, but one of the biggest complaints has historically been the **usability of the UI and visualizations**.  

While the UI works well for developers and administrators of Zabbix, end-users often struggle to extract meaningful metrics/data.  

- **Zabbix 6.4** introduced custom modules and widgets.  
- **Zabbix 7.0** added the communication framework for dashboards — a crucial step forward.  

This widget was created to **fill the gap** in a flexible, powerful table visualizations for dashboards.  

Even though Zabbix introduced [TopItems](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/dashboards/widgets/top_items), many features were missing to create a truly powerful experience. That’s why this widget exists.

## ✍️ Author’s Notes

- Originally cloned from the [TopItems](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/dashboards/widgets/top_items) widget for its solid foundation.
- Significantly expanded with **new features** and enhancements.
- Goal:  
  - Provide immediate community value.  
  - Spark interest in further improvement.  
  - Possibly gain Zabbix’s attention to integrate this natively.

---

## 🔮 Future Development

- Continue polishing bugs and usability issues.  
- Expand **column filtering** to all columns with more filter conditions.   
- Ongoing code cleanup (move logic from JavaScript → PHP + CSS).

## ⚡ Functionality & Features

✔️ **Layouts**
- **3 Column**: True Top/Bottom N table (metric name | host | value).  
- **Column per pattern**: One column per configured item pattern. Supports grouping by item tags as well as `{HOST.HOST}` to enable a similar layout to `Horizontal`.
  - As such, it is very important now to make heavy use of tags on your items to make maximum use of this widget and truly unlock its power.

✔️ **Communication Framework**
- Receives **broadcasted inputs** of host groups, hosts, and as of recently, items.  
- Broadcasts hosts and items by clicking cells.  
- Fully leverages Zabbix [dynamic parameters framework](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/dashboards/widgets#dynamic-parameters).

✔️ **Advanced Table Behavior**
- Sortable columns (correctly handles `B`, `bps`, `s`, `unixtime`, etc.).  
- Automatic pagination after **75 rows**.  
- Column filtering (first column):  
  - Filter types: Contains, Equals, Starts/Ends with, Wildcard, Not Contains, Regex, and Boolean Expression.  
  - Green funnel = filter active, Red funnel = invalid regex.  
- Footer row with **Sum** or **Average**.  
- Column-specific overrides for aggregations (Sum, Avg, Min, Max).
- Ability to customize how value mapped values are displayed.  
- Column display option of URL added to allow for items represented as URLs to be clickable.  
- URL display option allows for complete customization of the display text and generating fully customized URLs.  
- Customizable item headers using Zabbix macros (e.g., regex replace).  
- Configuration control of autoselection of first host and item table cell for instant broadcasting.  
- Reset row capability (broadcasts hostid `000000` to reset linked widgets).  
- Support for **aggregations across multiple hosts/items**.
- Multi-cell selection (`Ctrl` + click, `Shift` + click) → broadcasts all selected itemids.  
- **Groupings-only mode**: Use the widget as a **dashboard filter** for other tables.  
- **Bar gauge proportions** in rows/columns as well as tooltip showing ratio to other table cells as a percentage.  
- **Aggregate by item groupings** (not just hosts) for high-level overviews → drill down into details with clicks.
